Operating systems serve as the backbone of modern computing, managing hardware resources and enabling user interaction with software applications. This project aims to explore the inner mechanisms of an operating system by developing a simplified OS prototype that mirrors the essential features of a real-world system, including process management, memory control, and file handling.

ii.  Problem Statement:

Despite the availability of powerful operating systems, many users and students lack an understanding of how these systems function internally. Traditional learning methods often fall short of offering hands-on experience with OS development. There is a need for a simplified, educational OS model that demonstrates core principles in an interactive and practical way.

iii.  Scope and Goals:

The scope of this project includes the design and implementation of a lightweight operating system prototype focusing on core functionalities such as process scheduling, memory allocation, and basic I/O management. The primary goals are:
•	To reinforce theoretical knowledge through practical application.
•	To create a modular and easy-to-understand system architecture.
•	To support simple multitasking and basic file operations.
•	To build a foundation for further extension into more complex OS concepts
